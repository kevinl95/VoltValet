VoltValet can interface with any J1772 EV charger. It can classify anomalous charger signals and determine if a charger has gone offline. It can alert a user for maintenance via email using a simple and secure cloud service. Volt Valet makes any EV charger smart, and can be a component that can make public EV charging more reliable as we move towards a more resilient and green future! Thanks to the AVR-IoT Mini, we can do all of this- machine learning, cloud connectivity, and signal analysis, on the edge in the field where public infrastructure already exists today.
